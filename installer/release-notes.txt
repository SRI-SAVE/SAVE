2/20/15	Upped the version to 1.2, so SAVE-1.3-installer
		Updated the install instructions to use the installtree.zip only with
		no need for a clone of SAVE or VWF git repos since the files were
		duplicated.

1/30/15	Changed name of installer to SAVE-1.1-installer

1/28/15 Added .behave folder to VWF/public/CAT and VWF/public/published/clearing 
		Added missing installer directory
		Had to manually install VWF modules. Steps ot recreate:
			1. Create the C:\Users\[your user]\Appdata\Roaming\npm directory.
			2. In the VWF directory run npm install
		Have to remove the 3rd party installers from the SAVE-src directory
		because they are redundant.
		
1/26/15	Replaced installer creation program to Advanced Installer due to the
		previous product crashing.
		Still have to add
			backend.properties
			log_config.xml
			node-server.cmd
			save-1.1.url
		by hand to the bin directory
		
		Remove the third party installers from the SAVE-src tree as this is not
		needed and redundant.

1/21/15	Changed default install path to root of C drive. C:\SRI\SAVE
		Replaced 32 bit Java online installer with 64 bit local installer
		Replaced 32 bit Nodejs installer with 64 bit version
		Manually placed backend.properties and log_config.xml in bin directory
		Manually placed XSB sub-tree in SAVE root tree.

1/19/15	Initial build
